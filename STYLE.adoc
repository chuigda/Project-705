= Styling guide

== 0. Basic coding styles
1. **Three spaces** indentation.
2. UTF-8 **without BOM**, that's windows shit. Don't edit things with Windows notepad or write pad.
3. Always use **LF**, not **CRLF**, unless necessary (like in HTTP).
4. Swear words are allowed but only when talking about the badness of fucking 3rd party libraries, or the badness of Chuigda.
5. Name files in `snake_case` (so they would look like paradox things), unless certain naming is wanted by some auto tools.
6. Enable `eslint` when possible. If you think some rule is annoying, confirm with Chuigda.

== 1. Rules for protocol
1. Always use `interface`, not `class`, and make sure everything serializable / deserializable via `JSON.stringify` / `JSON.parse`.
2. Some `string | Ident` things will always be transformed into `string` during _mod compilation_, so you may simply use `string` under such circumstance.
3. However, always use `ITranslationKey` or `ITranslatable`, to indicate that something is potentially a translatable item.

== 2. Rules for backstage programming
1. Always use `interface` for rule set things. Downstream mod manufacturers aren't able to construct our `class`.
2. Under other circumstances, only use `class` if you find you need a method or you want something like a constructor.
3. When some API needs to be exposed to downstream mod manufacturers, plug that API to `GameContext` so that it could be accessible.
4. When designing a new module, if you find you need some user-defined executable code, think about event system first.
5. Use `typeAssert` to validate mods and requests. When adding a new module, ensure relevant type assertions are added.

== 3. Rules for frontend programming
1. Though we're naming files with `snake_case`, components should still use `PascalCase` while variables should still use `camelCase`.
2. Some eslint rules of backstage (mainly airbnb rules) was not ported to frontend `.eslintrc` due to some compatibility reason. But it's still expected to follow these rules.

== 4. Collaboration
1. **KEAL** (**K**eep **E**veryone **AL**ive), or **It will KEAL**, instead of traditional LGTM.
2. Using poetry (nonsense) commit messages for trivial commits is acceptable.
3. Using poetry (nonsense) pull request messages is acceptable.
4. Don't talk about politics or current events all the time. Also, avoid such things in game contents. However, if you're so yygq or abstract that nobody else could understand your true meaning, you may do that.
